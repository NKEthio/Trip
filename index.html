        <p>My trip in Ethiopian National Museum
            The museum houses Ethiopia's artistic treasures. It contains many precious local archaeological finds such as the fossilized remains of early hominids, the most famous of which is "Lucy," the partial skeleton of a specimen of Australopithecus afarensis. 
            Recently added to the basement gallery is a display on Selam, found between 2000 and 2004. This archaic fossil is estimated to date to 3.3 million years ago.</p>
             
        <p>Since my friend and I are local visitors we buy entrance ticket and start our visiting. First we thought the whole place is to be visited, but latter we realized that there is a specific building for it. 
            getting into underground [basement gallery]. We found fossils that have the age of millions.</p>
        <p>For me, talking about millions of years was just a miracle [Lucy was also there]. When we go up to the first floor we got writing and small monuments and different spiritual writing that explain about ancient history of Ethiopia. On the next floors we saw very astonishing arts of Ethiopian painters.</p>
            
        <p>Generally my trip to Ethiopian national museum was a great experience because I had the chance to see many interesting artifacts and learn about the was amazing! and one of unforgettable event in my life</p>
